# react-billboard
React component visually emulating a dot matrix billboard.

This is my pet project under development.

I realized that online billboard realizations have great potential in web advertising.
My take is photorealistic rendering of the physical stuff to work as
captivating decoration in online advertising. It touches on other cool customer interaction
potentials that can be taken online, such as direct ad interaction. I kept my web domain
"talk2ad.com" for this purpose, to harbor how people can interact / communicate with ads.

Dreams dreamt back in 2015 or so does not seem to have been shattered by anyone so far
other than my development of the concept got delayed by other wonderful activities.
